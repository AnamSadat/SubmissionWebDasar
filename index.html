            Hello! I’m Anam, a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in
            Cloud Computing, Web Development, and Machine Learning. With a
            background in Informatics Engineering, I constantly explore how
            technology can be leveraged to create innovative solutions with
            real-world impact.I have worked on various projects, ranging from
            data analysis and web development to cloud-based service
            integrations. Currently, I’m deepening my expertise in the Google
            Cloud ecosystem and developing projects focused on digital solutions
            for healthcare, education, and tourism.Additionally, I actively
            participate in tech communities and continuously strive to enhance
            my skills. I believe that great technology is not just about writing
            code, but also about how it benefits people.

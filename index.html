              <h4>JavaScript & TypeScript</h4>
              <p>
                JavaScript is my primary language for web development, both
                front-end and back-end. I am also proficient in TypeScript,
                which enhances code structure with static typing, helping to
                reduce bugs and improve code readability and scalability for
                complex projects. With TypeScript, I can develop applications
                that are more reliable and maintainable, particularly in
                enterprise-scale applications.
